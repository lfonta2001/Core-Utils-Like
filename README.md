# Implementation of Core-Utils CLI commands

This is a personal proyect to understand more about Linux utilities and structure.

## Commands beeing implemented

- ls: C

### Languages

Most commands will be developed in C, some of them will probably also be implemented in Rust but it is unlikely to be all of them unless i change my mind.

Some bash scripts may be implemented to aid the main implementations.
